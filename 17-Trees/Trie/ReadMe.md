Here's a complete and easy-to-understand guide to **Tries** üî§ ‚Äî a powerful data structure for handling strings, especially in dictionary-based problems like autocomplete, spell checking, and pattern matching.

---

## üå≥ What is a **Trie**?

### üîπ **Definition**:
A **Trie** (pronounced *‚Äútry‚Äù*) is a **tree-like data structure** used to **store a dynamic set of strings**, where **each node represents a character** of a string.

> üìå Also known as a **Prefix Tree** because it efficiently stores and searches strings based on their **prefixes**.

---

## üì¶ Trie Structure:

- **Each node** represents a single character.
- **Each path from root to a leaf** represents a word.
- **Edges** correspond to characters.
- Nodes contain:
  - A **character**
  - A map/array of **children**
  - An **end-of-word flag** (`isEnd`)

---

### üî§ Example:

Inserting the words `["cat", "car", "care"]`:

```
       (root)
        / 
       c
      /
     a
    / \
   t   r
        \
         e
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Trie Operations:

| Operation     | Description                                 | Time Complexity |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------|
| **Insert**    | Add a word character by character            | O(L)             |
| **Search**    | Check if a word exists                       | O(L)             |
| **StartsWith**| Check if any word starts with a prefix       | O(L)             |
| **Delete**    | Remove a word                                | O(L)             |

> üî∏ L = Length of the word  
> üî∏ Each character is processed in constant time, assuming fixed alphabet (e.g., 26 letters for lowercase)

---

## ‚è±Ô∏è Time & Space Complexity:

| Operation        | Time       | Space        |
|------------------|------------|--------------|
| Insert/Search    | O(L)       | O(ALPHABET √ó N) |
| Prefix Matching  | O(L)       | O(1)         |

- **ALPHABET**: Total possible characters (26 for lowercase)
- **N**: Total words inserted

---

## ‚úÖ Advantages of Trie:

- **Faster lookups** for strings than hash tables in some cases
- **Prefix-based search** is very efficient
- Avoids storing duplicate prefixes ‚Üí **space-optimized for similar words**
- Can be used to implement **Autocomplete**, **Spell Check**, and **T9 Predictive Text**

---

## ‚ùå Disadvantages:

- **High memory usage** for sparse data (lots of unused children pointers)
- More complex than simple hash tables for basic tasks
