### ðŸ”· What is Dynamic Programming?

Dynamic Programming is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems and storing the results of these subproblems to avoid redundant work.

---

### ðŸ”· Types of DP

There are two main ways to implement DP in Java:

#### 1. **Top-Down (Memoization)**

Use recursion + caching (memoization) to avoid recalculating results.

#### 2. **Bottom-Up (Tabulation)**

Build up the solution iteratively using an array or table.

## ðŸŸ¢ Memoization (Top-Down)

Uses **recursion + caching** (usually a HashMap or array).

### ðŸ”§ General Time Complexity:

* **O(N)** â€” each unique subproblem is solved once.
* Recursive calls only happen for inputs that havenâ€™t been memoized yet.

### ðŸ’¾ Space Complexity:

* **O(N)** for the memoization table (cache).
* **O(N)** for the recursive call stack (because of depth = N).

### ðŸ“¦ Total Space: **O(N + N) = O(N)**

---

## ðŸ”µ Tabulation (Bottom-Up)

Uses **iteration** and fills up a table (usually an array).

### ðŸ”§ General Time Complexity:

* **O(N)** â€” we compute values iteratively from smallest to largest.

### ðŸ’¾ Space Complexity:

* **O(N)** for the DP table (e.g., `dp[]` array).
* **O(1)** stack space (no recursion).

### ðŸ“¦ Total Space: **O(N + 1) = O(N)**
